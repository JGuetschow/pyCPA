Python-based tool for Climate Policy Analysis.

This is early development status and currently not intended for wider use but only a few special tasks.

Currently the main use cases are 
* conversion of greenhouse gas emissions data between different sector specifications
* consistency check of datasets
* analysis of data coverage in, i.e. which combinations of metadata values (region, gas, sectors, ...) have data.


Functionality and some code will be included in the redesign of the PRIMAP emissions-module.
